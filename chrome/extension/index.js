 *
 * 1) Opening Yoroi by pressing the Yoroi icon
 * In this case, Chrome only allows you to load one copy of Yoroi at the same time.
 * This restriction applies even across multiple copies of Chrome running at the same time
 * Since Yoroi takes more than a millisecond to open, the time will always be unique.
 *
 * 2) Manually entering the Yoroi URL into a page multiple times
 * This bypasses above-mentioned restriction of only one copy loading at once
 * Emperically, this doesn't seem to be an issue though.
